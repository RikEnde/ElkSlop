 * not have side effects (reading a timer or a keyboard register to show it must
 * not acknowledge it), and asks [label] for a name for each address an operand
 * names, so a machine can show `JSR OSWRCH` instead of `JSR $FFEE`.
 *
 * Addresses wrap at 64 KiB, as on the CPU. Bytes after the end of memory come
 * from the start.
 *
 * Code is often stored in one place and copied elsewhere to run, as a
 * decompressor does. Each method takes an `origin`: the address the code will
 * run from. The bytes are read where they are now, but the listing numbers
 * them from the origin, and branch destinations count from it, so they match
 * the code once it is in place. The origin is the address read by default.
